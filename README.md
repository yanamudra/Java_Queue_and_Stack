Baggage Handling System
## Project Description
It is a simulation system for an airport baggage handling system (BHS). The BHS is a semi-automated system responsible for storing baggage after check-in until it's time to load it onto the aircraft.

In this system, standard baggage is placed on a circular conveyor belt with a single access point for both loading and unloading. When a bag is ready for aircraft loading, the conveyor belt rotates until the bag is positioned in front of the access point, allowing it to be removed.

On the other hand, special baggage, typically larger and bulkier, is stored in a designated storage room. These bags are arranged sequentially, one behind the other. To retrieve a special bag that is not at the front of the storage room, bags in front of it must be removed one by one and temporarily stored in a separate room with similar storage characteristics. This process allows access to the desired special bag.
